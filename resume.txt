## Professional Experience
* Data Scientist : 2022-06~2024-07
- Designed and built the full ETL data transformation pipeline and and KPI dashboard for P&G UK and Germany's loyalty program. Cleaned and standardized raw, inconsistent datasets (e.g., merging 15+ tables and harmonising gender labels) into consolidated analytics tables. After continuous optimization, dashboard update time was reduced from 8 hours to under 15 minutes. The project's impact led to a 56% increase in project hours(UK: 2h→8h/week; DACH: 16h→20h/week) due to outstanding client satisfaction. 
- Developed accurate KPI forecasting charts using ARIMA and other statistical models, providing highly actionable insights for campaign planning, which clients consistently praised.
- Maintained close communication with P&G stakeholders and offshore data engineering team in India through weekly meetings, proactively incorporating feedback and aligning deliverables with evolving business needs.
- Deployed in-house machine learning algorithms to optimize ad campaigns (Google DV360, Xandr) for clients including Moleskine and SEB, aligning each use case with business KPIs, persona, and product types.
